- [x] Biquad Python objekt
- [x] Delay line (fixed)
- [x] Delay line (variable, integer sample)
- [x] Vibrato (doppler-delay)
- [x] 1x vibrato + direct = flanger

- Delay line (variable, fractional)
- Implement mkbiquad as a python object?
- Overdrive - oversampling to reduce aliasing effects? Pre- and postfilters?
- Tremolo (AM)
- 1st order filter Python objekt
- Integrator (with DC removal filter)
- Vibrato with “rise time” on depth!
- Crossover! - IIR Linkwitz-Riley!
- Compressor! - Take GTEU DRC, but implement delay line!
- Leslie (strymon lex and Ventilator II controls, slow and high speed, rampup time /different for horn and woofer/, woofer and horn blend, mic distance (direct-to-reverb ratio) + overdrive + independent stereo spread on drum and horn
- Multiband leslie??
- Nx random vibrato + direct = chorus 
- Generalized parallel comb filters for reverb

Interface expression pedal with max?
