- [x] Biquad Python objekt
- [x] Delay line (fixed)
- [x] Delay line (variable, integer sample)
- [x] Vibrato (doppler-delay)
- [x] 1x vibrato + direct = flanger
- [x] Tremolo (AM)

- Something sounds wrong with the Crybaby MaxMSP object when built for Windows... it is as if the biquad coefficients are generated for 16k FS and not 48k... look into this. Matlab and Python model sound good.
- Tremolo - pre-gain
- Overdrive: Exp. method, function selector
- Delay line (variable, fractional)
- Implement mkbiquad as a python object?
- Overdrive - oversampling to reduce aliasing effects? Pre- and postfilters?
- 1st order filter Python objekt
- Integrator (with DC removal filter)
- Vibrato with “rise time” on depth!
- Crossover! - IIR Linkwitz-Riley!
- Compressor! - Take GTEU DRC, but implement delay line!
- Leslie (strymon lex and Ventilator II controls, slow and high speed, rampup time /different for horn and woofer/, woofer and horn blend, mic distance (direct-to-reverb ratio) + overdrive + independent stereo spread on drum and horn
- Nx random vibrato + direct = chorus 
- Generalized parallel comb filters for reverb

Interface expression pedal with max?
